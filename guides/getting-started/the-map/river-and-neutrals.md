# River and Neutral Objectives

The **river** is the area that runs diagonally through the center of the map, connecting the three lanes.  

It is important because it contains **neutral objectives** that give your team significant advantages.  

### Key Objectives

- **Dragon**: Grants buffs to the team that kills it. Each type of dragon provides a different bonus. Upon slaying four of them, claim the Dragon Soul.
- **Voidgrubs**: Helps push lanes by slowly disintegrating enemy turrets when a champion attacks them.
- **Rift Herald**: Helps push lanes by summoning a strong creature to attack enemy structures.  
- **Baron Nashor**: A powerful monster that gives a temporary buff to the entire team, improving minions and combat strength.  
- **Elder Drake**: Appears after the Dragon Soul has been claimed. It provides the team that kills it with a powerful burn, and executes enemy champions. 

### Why Objectives Matter

Objectives are often more important than kills because they directly help your entire team **destroy towers and inhibitors**, leading to the Nexus.  

Controlling the river and objectives allows your team to:  
- Secure global advantages  
- Pressure lanes more effectively  
- Limit the enemy team’s options
