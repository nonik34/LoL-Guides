# The Jungle

The **jungle** is the area of the map between the lanes, filled with neutral monsters.  

Unlike lanes, the jungle is not controlled by either team, and there are no towers directly in the jungle.  

### Purpose of the Jungle
- Provides **experience and gold** by killing neutral monsters  
- Allows champions to **roam** and assist lanes  
- Helps control important objectives such as **Dragon** and **Baron Nashor**  

### Jungler Role
One player on each team takes the **jungler role**.  

Responsibilities include:  
- Clearing jungle camps efficiently  
- Helping teammates in their respective lane (commonly referred to as **ganking**)  
- Securing neutral objectives  
- Providing vision and map control (shared responsibility with supports)  

The jungle is important because it allows the team to influence all lanes and objectives, not just one.
