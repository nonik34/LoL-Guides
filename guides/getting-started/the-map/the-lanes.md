# The Lanes

The main map in League of Legends, **Summoner’s Rift**, is divided into three lanes: **Top**, **Mid**, and **Bottom**.  

Lanes are the primary paths where champions move and fight. Each lane is protected by towers, inhibitors, and minions.  

### Top Lane
- Usually played by champions who are durable or can fight one-on-one  
- Likely a melee champion
- Focuses either on surviving and scaling into the late game  
- Or winning by denying resources from the enemy player

### Mid Lane
- Typically played by champions that require safety in the early stages of the game  
- Often the center of action, able to roam to other lanes  

### Bottom Lane
- Usually has two players: one **Attack Damage Carry (ADC)** and one **Support**  
- ADC tends to be weak on their own, is almost certainly a ranged champion, and focuses on dealing damage  
- Support helps the ADC survive and controls the lane  

Lanes serve multiple purposes:  
- Provide a structured way to advance toward the enemy base  
- Allow champions to gain gold and experience from minions  
- Create opportunities for fighting and map control  

There are of course outliars, like squishy (non-durable) toplaners,  
midlaners who can dominate early, and non-traditional ADCs (APCs or melee ADCs),  
but they are essential parts of the game and give more options to the player.
