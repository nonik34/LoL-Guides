# Champion Classes

Champions in League of Legends are often grouped into **classes** based on their general playstyle and role on the team.  

The main classes are:  

- **Fighters**: Durable champions who deal consistent damage and often fight in the front line  
- **Mages**: Champions that deal high magic damage, usually from a distance  
- **Marksmen (ADCs)**: Ranged champions who deal sustained physical damage, typically in the bottom lane  
- **Tanks**: Champions with high health and resistances, able to absorb damage for their team  
- **Supports**: Champions that assist allies with healing, shields, crowd control, or vision  
- **Assassins**: Champions that specialize in quickly eliminating high-priority targets  

Each class has strengths and weaknesses.  
Most Champions fit neatly into a class, but there are some that overlap between two or more classes.  

Understanding the general characteristics of your champion’s class helps you:  

- Decide how to play in fights  
- Know what to prioritize in itemization  
- Work effectively with your team
