# Champion Abilities

Each champion has a set of **abilities** that make them unique.  

Abilities are used to attack, defend, or assist your team. Every champion has:  

- **Passive Ability**: Works automatically or under certain conditions without being activated  
- **Q / W / E Abilities**: Usually active skills you can use by pressing the corresponding keys  
- **Ultimate Ability (R)**: A powerful ability with a longer cooldown that often changes the outcome of fights  

Most abilities have **cooldowns**, which is the time you must wait before using them again.  

Some abilities also use **resources**, such as mana, energy, or other champion-specific resources.  

Understanding abilities is important because:  
- They define how your champion fights  
- They influence how you position in fights  
- They affect how you interact with enemy champions and objectives
