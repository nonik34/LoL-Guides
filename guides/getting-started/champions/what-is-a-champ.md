# What is a Champion?

A **champion** is the character that you control in League of Legends.  

Each player selects **one champion** at the start of a match.  

Champions are unique and have their own:  
- **Abilities**: Special powers used to attack, defend, or assist teammates  
- **Stats**: Numbers that define health, damage, speed, and other attributes  
- **Role**: The position and responsibilities on the team  

You control a champion throughout the match. As the game progresses, your champion becomes stronger by:  
- Gaining **experience** to level up  
- Earning **gold** to buy items  
- Using abilities effectively in fights  

Understanding your champion is crucial because it determines:  
- How you fight enemies  
- How you move around the map  
- How you help your team achieve objectives
