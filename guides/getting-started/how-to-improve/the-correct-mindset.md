# The Correct Mindset

This chapter is optional but **strongly recommended** for all new players.  
Adopting the right mindset early can make learning League of Legends
much more fun and way effectiver.  

### Key Principles

- **You will lose**: Losing is a natural part of the learning process.  
  Every player, even professionals, loses games.  
  The important part is to take
  each loss as an opportunity to learn something new about the game, your
  champion, or your decision-making.  

- **Learning > Winning**: Focus on improving rather than just winning.  
  Wins are temporary, but understanding the mechanics, map, and team
  interactions will improve your performance over the long term.  
  Track your progress by noting what you learned each game, not only the final
  score.  

- **Focus on fundamentals**: Core skills like farming minions, controlling
  objectives, positioning in fights, and understanding map awareness  
  are more
  important than fancy plays. Mastering these basics will give you a solid
  foundation for any champion or role.  

- **One role, few champions**: Limit yourself to a single role and a small pool
  of champions at first.  
  This allows you to learn the responsibilities of that
  role and understand champion mechanics without spreading yourself too thin.  

By following these principles, you:  
- Set realistic expectations for your performance  
- Reduce frustration and tilt  
- Build habits that will carry over as you expand to more roles and
  champions  

Remember, improvement in League of Legends is **gradual**. Consistency,
patience, and reflection are more important than chasing wins.  
Treat each
match as a lesson, and over time, you will notice significant progress.  

Good luck Summoner, and have fun on the Rift!
