# What Is a Role?

A **role** describes what a champion is expected to do for their team during a
match.  

Roles are not the same as champion classes.  
Instead, roles are based on **responsibilities** and **map position**.  

Each team has five players, and each player usually takes a different role to
cover all necessary tasks, such as:  
- Dealing damage  
- Absorbing damage  
- Controlling the map  
- Supporting teammates  

Roles exist to create structure and balance within a team.  
If everyone tried to do the same thing, the team would be weaker overall.  

Understanding roles helps you:  
- Know where to go on the map  
- Understand what your team expects from you  
- Make better decisions during fights and objectives
