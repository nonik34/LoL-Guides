# What Are Stats?

**Stats** are numerical values that determine how strong your champion is and
how they interact with the game.  

Stats affect almost everything your champion does, including:  
- How much damage you deal  
- How much damage you can take  
- How fast you move or attack  
- How often you can use abilities  

Every champion has base stats that increase as they level up.  
Items and other systems can further increase these stats.  

Understanding stats is important because:  
- The right stats make your champion more effective  
- Buying the wrong stats can make your champion weaker in comparison to others  
- Good stat choices help you survive fights and win objectives  

Learning what they do is essential before choosing items or runes.
