# How Stats Interact

Stats in League of Legends do not work in isolation.
They interact with each other to determine how effective a champion is.  

## Damage and Defense

There are two main types of damage in the game:  
- **Physical damage**
- **Magic damage**  

Armor reduces physical damage.  
Magic Resist reduces magic damage.  

Buying magic resist against a physical-damage champion is ineffective, and buying armor against a magic-damage champion provides little value.  

## Health and Resistances

Health determines how much damage you can take in total.  
Armor and magic resist determine how much damage is reduced.  

- High health with no resistances can be melted quickly  
- High resistances with very low health can still result in quick deaths  

Most durable champions benefit from a balance of both.  

## Damage Stats and Ability Scaling

Some abilities scale with **Attack Damage**, others with **Ability Power**.  

Buying the wrong damage stat may increase your numbers but not actually improve
your abilities.  

## Cooldowns and Ability Usage

Ability Haste allows you to use abilities more often.  

For champions that rely on abilities to deal damage or provide utility, reducing
cooldowns can be more valuable than increasing raw damage.
