# Item Components

Most items in League of Legends are built from **smaller items**, called
components.  

Instead of buying one large item all at once, you usually buy its components
over time as you earn gold.  

Item components are important because:  
- They provide stats immediately  
- They allow gradual power increases  
- They make item progression smoother  

For example, a large damage item may be built from:  
- A small damage component  
- An attack speed component  
- A combine cost paid at the end  

You do not always need to finish an item immediately.  
Sometimes it is better to buy useful components first, depending on the game
situation.  

Buying components first doesn't make purchasing the finished item more expensive.
