# What Are Items?

**Items** are upgrades that you buy with gold to make your champion stronger.  

Items provide stats such as damage, health, resistances, or utility effects.  

You can buy items only while your champion is in the **shop**, which is located
inside your team’s base.  

Items are important because:  
- Champions start weak and scale through items  
- Items define how a champion performs in fights  
- Different items support different playstyles  

Each champion can hold a limited number of items at a time, so choosing the
right ones matters.  

Other than stats, most items give passive benefits, while some can be used actively by pressing the key to the corresponding slot in your inventory.  
Items can be moved in your inventory by clicking and dragging them to a different slot.
