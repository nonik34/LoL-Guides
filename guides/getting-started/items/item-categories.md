# Item Categories

Items in League of Legends can be grouped into broad **categories** based on
what they provide and how they affect gameplay.  

## Damage Items

Damage items increase how much damage your champion deals.  

- Can increase **Attack Damage**, **Ability Power**, or **Attack Speed**  
- Often used by carries and damage-focused champions  
- Help secure kills and pressure objectives  

## Defensive Items

Defensive items increase your ability to survive.  

- Provide **health**, **armor**, or **magic resist**  
- Reduce the damage you take in fights  
- Commonly built by tanks and front-line champions  

## Utility Items

Utility items provide effects beyond raw damage or defense.  

- May grant movement speed, healing, shields, or crowd control  
- Can improve team fighting and map control  
- Often built by supports and some fighters  

Most champions build a combination of these categories.
