# What are Summoner Spells?

**Summoner spells** are powerful abilities that every champion can use,
regardless of which champion they are playing.  

You choose **two summoner spells** before the game starts.  
Once the game begins, they usually cannot be changed.  

Summoner spells have long cooldowns, meaning they can only be used occasionally,
but their effects are very impactful.  

Common examples include:  
- **Flash**: Instantly teleports your champion a short distance  
- **Heal**: Restores health to you and an ally  
- **Ignite**: Deals damage over time to an enemy champion  
- **Smite**: Taken by junglers, it deals massive damage to monsters  

Summoner spells are important because they:  
- Can save your life in dangerous situations  
- Help secure kills or objectives  
- Define how aggressive or defensive you can play
