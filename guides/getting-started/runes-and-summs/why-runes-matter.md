# Why Runes Matter

Runes have a significant impact on how a champion performs, especially in the
early stages of the game.  

They can provide advantages such as:  
- Increased damage or survivability  
- Better sustain in lane  
- Improved mobility or cooldown reduction  

Because runes are chosen before the match starts, they shape your playstyle
from the very beginning.  

Choosing the wrong runes can make your champion weaker, even if you play well.  
Choosing the right runes can make difficult situations easier to handle.  

Runes do not replace good decision-making or mechanics, but they enhance your
champion’s strengths and help cover weaknesses.  

Later role and champion guides will explain which runes are commonly used and
why they work.
