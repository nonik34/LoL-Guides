# What Are Runes?

**Runes** are bonuses that you choose **before the game starts**.  

They provide extra stats and effects that influence how your champion plays
from the very beginning of the match.  

Runes are not items and do not cost gold.  
Once the game begins, your runes cannot be changed.  

Runes are important because they:  
- Strengthen your champion early in the game  
- Support specific playstyles  
- Complement your champion’s abilities and role  

Each champion benefits from different runes depending on how they are meant to
be played.
