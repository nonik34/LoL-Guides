# Gold

**Gold** is the currency used in League of Legends to buy items for your champion.  

You earn gold primarily by:  
- Killing **minions or monsters**  
- Killing **enemy champions**  
- Destroying **enemy structures**  
- Collecting certain neutral objectives in the jungle  

Gold allows you to purchase **items** that make your champion stronger.  

Managing gold effectively is important because:  
- Spending gold efficiently increases your power relative to the enemy  
- Saving gold for the right items can change the outcome of fights  
- Wasting gold or dying while holding it can give the enemy an advantage  

Learning how to farm minions efficiently is the simplest way to guarantee a lead over the enemy.
