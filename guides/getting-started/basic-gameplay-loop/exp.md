# Experience and Levels

**Experience (EXP)** is gained by being near minions, monsters, or champions
when they are killed.  

As your champion gains experience, they **level up**.  

Leveling up provides:  
- **Ability points** to improve your champion’s skills  
- **Stat increases** such as health, damage, and defenses  

Each champion has a maximum level, usually **level 18**.  

Understanding experience is important because:  
- Higher-level champions are stronger than lower-level champions  
- Being ahead in levels can give your team an advantage in fights  
- Missing experience by staying away from lanes or dying can put you behind  

**Power spikes** occur when a champion reaches certain levels unlocks key abilities, or aquires certain items.  
Recognizing these moments helps you decide when to fight or play safely.
