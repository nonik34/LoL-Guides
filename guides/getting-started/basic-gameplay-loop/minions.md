# Minions

**Minions** are small AI-controlled units that march down each lane toward the enemy base.  

They are important because they:  
- Provide **gold** when killed, which allows you to buy items  
- Provide **experience**, which levels up your champion  
- Help **push lanes** toward enemy towers and structures  

There are different types of minions:  
- **Melee minions**: Close-range fighters  
- **Caster minions**: Deal damage from a distance  
- **Cannon minions**: Tougher minions that appear periodically and deal more damage to structures
- **Super minions**: Extreme powerhouses that appear in their respective lane after taking down the inhibitor  

Minions automatically attack enemy minions, towers, and champions in range.  

Understanding minions is important because:  
- Killing them efficiently increases your gold and experience advantage  
- They can absorb damage from towers, allowing you to attack safely  
- They affect wave control, which is a key part of map strategy
