# Why Kills Are Not the Objective

A common beginner mistake is thinking that the goal of League of Legends is to get as many kills as possible.  

While killing enemy champions can help your team, **kills alone do not win the game**.  

Kills provide two main benefits:  
- **Gold**: Allows you to buy items and become stronger  
- **Experience**: Levels up your champion and improves your abilities  

These advantages help your team take **objectives**, such as towers, inhibitors, and the Nexus.  

Focusing only on kills can be risky because:  
- You may die and give the enemy team gold and experience  
- You may ignore important objectives on the map  
- Your team may lose opportunities to control the game  

Winning depends on a combination of **teamwork, map control, and objectives**, not just individual kills.  

Always remember: **kills are a tool, not the goal.**
