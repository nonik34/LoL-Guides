# Towers, Inhibitors, and Progression

Before you can reach the Nexus, you must progress through the map.  

The map contains **defensive structures** that protect each team’s base. The main ones are **towers** and **inhibitors**.  

## Towers

Towers are powerful defensive structures located along each lane.  
They automatically attack enemy champions and minions that come too close.  

Towers:  
- Deal significant damage, especially to champions early in the game  
- *Must* be destroyed to advance toward the enemy base  
- Provide safety for your team when near them  

## Inhibitors

Inhibitors are located just behind the towers inside the base.  

- Destroying an enemy inhibitor gives your team **super minions** in that lane  
- Super minions are stronger than normal minions and help push lanes toward the enemy Nexus  
- Inhibitors respawn after a few minutes if not destroyed again  

## Map Progression

To win a game, your team must:  
1. Destroy towers to reach the base  
2. Destroy inhibitors to weaken enemy defenses  
3. Finally destroy the Nexus
