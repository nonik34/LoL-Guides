# Towers, Inhibitors, and Progression

Before you can reach the Nexus, you must progress through the map.  

The map contains **defensive structures** that protect each team’s base. The main ones are **towers** and **inhibitors**.  

## Towers

Towers, also known as Turrets are powerful defensive structures located along each lane.  
They automatically attack enemy champions and minions that come too close.  

Towers prioritize attacking cannon minions, then the closest minion in range.  
They attack champions if there are no minions nearby, or if an enemy champion damages an allied champion while in range.
Once a tower started attacking a champion, they don't switch targets until the champion leaves its range, or dies.

On each subsequent attack against a champion, towers heat up, dealing increased damage on the next attack.  
This effect stacks up to three times, and slowly disappeares if the tower hasn't attacked a champion in a while.

Towers have special shields called plates.  
Plates are represented by segments of the towers's health. Towers start with five plates.  
When a champion destroys a plate, they and nearby allies get a small amount of gold and the tower gains resistances.

Destroying a tower grants local and global gold.
Local gold is split between nearby allies upon destruction, while global gold is granted to each teammate.

Towers:  
- Deal significant damage, especially to champions early in the game  
- Must be destroyed to advance toward the enemy base  
- Provide safety for your team when near them  

## Inhibitors

Inhibitors are located just behind the towers inside the base.  

- Destroying an enemy inhibitor gives your team **super minions** in that lane  
- Super minions are stronger than normal minions and help push lanes toward the enemy Nexus  
- Inhibitors respawn after a few minutes if not destroyed again  

## Map Progression

To win a game, your team must:  
1. Destroy towers to reach the base  
2. Destroy inhibitors to weaken enemy defenses  
3. Finally destroy the Nexus  

Alternatively, a team can decide to surrender after 15 minutes have passed.  
This action immediately destorys the surrendering teams Nexus and ends the game.
