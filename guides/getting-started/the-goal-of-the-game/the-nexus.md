# The Nexus

The **Nexus** is the most important structure in League of Legends.  

Each team has one Nexus, located inside their base at the far end of the map.  
The objective of every match is to **destroy the enemy Nexus**.  

When a Nexus is destroyed:  
- The game ends immediately  
- The team that destroyed it wins  

The Nexus does not move or attack on its own.  
It is protected by other structures and by enemy champions.  

Everything you do in a match helps your team reach and destroy the enemy Nexus.  

This includes:  
- Fighting enemy champions  
- Gaining gold and experience  
- Taking objectives on the map  
- Destroying enemy structures
