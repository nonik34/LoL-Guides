# What is League of Legends?

League of Legends is a **competitive online game**
played by two teams of five players each.  
Each player controls **one champion**.
Champions are powerful characters
with unique abilities and playstyles.

The game is played on a fixed map
called **Summoner’s Rift**.
Both teams start on opposite sides
of the same map.

The goal of every match is simple:  
Destroy the **enemy Nexus**.

The Nexus is a large structure
located in each team’s base.
When one Nexus is destroyed,
the game immediately ends.

League of Legends is a **team-based game**.
No single player can win alone.
Success depends on cooperation,
decision-making, and timing.

Matches are played in real time
and usually last between
**25 and 40 minutes**.

Every match starts from scratch:
- All champions begin at level 1
- No items are owned at the start
- No advantages carry over
from previous games
