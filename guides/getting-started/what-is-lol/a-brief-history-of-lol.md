# A Brief History of League of Legends

League of Legends was released in **2009** by a company called **Riot Games**.  

The game was inspired by earlier multiplayer and strategy games, but it was designed to be more accessible while still allowing for competitive depth.  
Over the years, League of Legends grew into one of the most played online games in the world, with millions of players across many regions.  

Riot Games updates the game on a regular basis.  
These updates can include balance changes, new champions, new items, and adjustments to existing systems.  
Because of these frequent updates, League of Legends is a **constantly evolving game**.  
While specific strategies may change over time, the core mechanics and fundamentals remain important.  

This is why learning how the game works is more valuable than memorizing or copying what others do without understanding the reasons behind it.
