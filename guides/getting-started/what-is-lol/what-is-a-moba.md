# What is a MOBA?

MOBA stands for **Multiplayer Online Battle Arena**.

This describes a type of video game with the following core ideas:

- **Multiplayer**: You play with and against other real players, not AI.
- **Online**: Matches are played over the internet on shared servers.
- **Battle**: Players fight using characters with unique abilities.
- **Arena**: All matches take place on a fixed map with defined objectives.

In a MOBA, two teams compete against each other.  
Each player controls **one character**, and the outcome of the match depends on how well the team works together rather than individual performance alone.

A typical MOBA match follows this structure:

- All players start at the same time with no advantages.
- During the match, players gain strength by playing well.
- This strength is temporary and only lasts for that match.
- When the match ends, everything resets.

MOBA games combine:
- Real-time action
- Strategic decision-making
- Team coordination

League of Legends is one of the most popular games in this genre.
