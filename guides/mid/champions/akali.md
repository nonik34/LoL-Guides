# AKALI GUIDE

## Combos:

passive: dive/trade  
r1 > e1: max range  
e > flash: doesnt extend range  
brush cheese: e1 > r1: r2 cd comes quicker, e guaranteed  
r2 > flash: extend range  
**IMPORTANTE!**: flash, r1, r2 cancels e2 damage if used too early,  
**HOWEVER** flashing INTO the enemy doesnt cancel the damage -> use to dodge skillshots or speed up e2  

## Ult Tips:

point blank r1 to escape over wall  
r2 has hitbox behind akali  

## E Tips:

wait with e2 if enemy has escape  
akali can follow: summoner TP, tf ult, shen ult with e2  
e2 > zhonya: still does e2 damage  

## Use W Properly:

w resets minion aggro: can trade while freezing  
w to auto-win trades: cant be aa-d  
tethers, true sight abilities and turrets **reveal** akali in her w  

## Early Laning Phase:

1. Stay healthy  
2. Farm  
3. Take good trades  
dshield + second wind  
*never* take extended trades lvl1  
lvl2 use shroud to trade if enemy misses abilities or steps up, alternatively use it to cs  
lvl3: 2 points in q, only scale e if you can all-in to kill  

## Trading Properly:

w > q > passive aa > spam q + passive aa  
safety e: e1 backwards on a minion > (w) > q > passive aa > (q) > e2  
land e1 for free -> can all-in with ult if below 60% hp  

## Winning Lane:

vs low-range enemies: trade them to 60% hp for the all in  
vs long-range opponents (azir, hwei, viktor etc.) freeze to do the same, safety e to chunk  
if cant kill for whatever reason: shove waves with q and w energy and roam  
EARLY GAME MATTERS A CRAP TON, DONT FALL BEHIND  

## Movespeed = DAMAG

first back look to buy: sorc shoes // merc threads (vs ap mid jg) // boots for 300g  
fleet footwork is free damage with safety e trading  

## Power Spikes

lvl 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13  
lvl 7: q 2-shots casters + probably have boots: can start roaming effectively  
lvl 9: can 1v1 any champ  
item spikes: completed items, especially first item  

## MACRO:

Akali is GIGA strong on sidelane.  
can escape with w, e, r, spam q on wave  
prioritise getting high cs even later on in the game  
push > roam  
option 1: sit in a brush in jg and use brush cheese combo  
option 2: move to flank potential teamfight  
buy sweeper and ONE pink ward, use them in enemy jg to make sure ur in fog  
**flank** enemy carry by TP-ing behind them  

## Teamfighting:

kill enemy backline, always try to flank with fog or TP  
dont be scared to buy pink wards, surprising the enemy is key  
if ur late or cant get a flank angle, walk into a nearby brush or chokepoint and wait for the enemy backline to misposition  
engage when your frontline tanks already engaged  
focus the Most fed enemy on backline (looking at you, 1/0/23 yuumi)  
land e and r2 on them  
if you cant fight, hide in shroud and wait for your team to arrive, if youre in 1v3 or worse you instantly die by doing anything else  
pressure by doing nothing  

## Final bonus tip: s key

If you hit all 6 enemy minions with a q, press s to stop in pace to make sure you can hit them again  

doing his saves up to 6-7 seconds on shoving making you faster on rotates to teamfights or into the enemy jg
