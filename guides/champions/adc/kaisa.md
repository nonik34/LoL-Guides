# KAISA GUIDE
### Combos:
auto > e > auto (if hob, auto x3 > e > auto)
auto > w > auto
auto > r > auto
w > flash
r > w
### Isolated Q:
Its better to kill one guy than to dps 3
+ Iso Q helps with passive damage
Use R to get to isolated spot
### Laning as Kaisa
Kaisa is short-ranged > cant poke > fast-pushing is not ideal
Slow push / Freeze is good
auto > q (to get cs aswell)
*(almost)* ONLY DO BURST TRADES
play around cooldowns
preserve hp, concede cs, all in at 6
don't use w in lane if you can all-in
### Delaying R:
plasma stays on target for 4 sec
wait for cd, and team positioning before ulting in
### Dueling & Splitpushing:
Kaisa CAN duel and splitpush
after q evo you have good waveclear
without other evos though, dont duel
once you have e evo, can start fighting (1.5-2 items)
dont fight in wave cuz no iso q = no kill = you die = no happy
use e defensively before using r (aa reduces e cd)
### Teamfighting:
You dont NEED to dive the backline
Just hit the frontline most of the time
Kaisa wants chaotic fights, structured 5v5s arent that good due to not havin the big flashy ults like mf
try to force a fight by pushing aggressively then roaming
### Macro as Kai'Sa:
Kaisa does a lot of dmg, has a dash, stealth = her power budget makes her more of a ranged bruiser than an actual marksman
She has no cc, a relatively short range for an adc, and her peeling is 50/50
*meaning* she HAS to play aggressively
if youre not fed, you cant do that
you should strive to have **7cspm** if you are BEHIND, but ideally **8.5cspm** is a must
luckily, you can splitpush and farm camps to do this
*play first, then think*
you need to get the most farm possible, even if your team dies while you do that
### Builds:
Kaisa builds are weird af
buying 2 dirk for q evo, getting an extra cull in ap build just to get q evo
>> dont rely on stat sites alone
look up kaisa replays on yt and sort by upload date
study 4-5 replays and look how they get q evo
repeat this every month or when kaisa core items get changed
### AP Kaisa:
If your team is lacking in AP, you can build ap with zhonyas + ult > you cant die
if you land 2 ws > someone dies
use w from fog or use q to clear wave then shoot w immediately
r > w is ESSENTIAL here
if you land w, wait for cd then r > w > q to oneshot
### Drafting:
If ally has lotsa easy to hit hard cc for plasma > engage support is high-prio
Dont pick with enchanter and mages, you WILL suffer in lane
If enemy is caitlyn lux > not happy
kaisa has a short range
### Evolve Cancels:
left click on hud to evolve > press e
saves less than 10 seconds per game but might get you a kill :3
