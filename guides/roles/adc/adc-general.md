# GENERAL ADC GUIDE
### Matchups:
  *all-in vs short burst trades*
**all-in** with melee sup: 
1. wave far from enemy tower (after bounce)
2. equal wave (minion damage, minion block)
3. FULL HP (*especially* in melee vs ranged matchup)
**short trades** with ranged sup:
1. push for prio (bigger wave)
2. slow push against melee for *big wave*
3. perma-shove vs ranged
### Parallel Positioning:
  *le triangle*
adapt to sup positioning
keep away from 1v2, keep in mind gameplan
### Rune Trades:
  look at runes for info: *one-tap/burst/ramp-up runes*
tells you who is favoured in trades > easy gameplan
kill tresholds:
0-30%: one-tap
30-50%: hob
50-70%: pta
70-100%: conq
**track rune cd**
if same setup > short range/long range
### Bad Supports:
  *they don't exist ;D (if you know why)*
if can: perma-shove waves so sup cant troll
if can: perma-bounce waves
**commit to a playstyle, and stick to it**
if anything else fails: **LET TOWER FALL**
then: rotate mid if enemy stays bot/stay bot if enemy rotates
### Early Drakes:
  *if bad call, ignore them*
early drakes rarely matter due to +5% buffs
early voidgrubs: never go, its insanely rare to get competent team for it
  only me playing poppy rotates to grubs, I've never seen any1 else do it (in platinum and below)
### Mechanics
  any gold player could do that these days
improve mental stack > just go limit-test, die, lose, idc
1. tracking cooldowns
2. last hitting
3. looking at map
hold abilities to overload enemy mental stack
click closer to ur chamion, increase apm
mix clicks > spam > slow click forward > juke for free dodge
look at enemy info panel (top left corner by default)
auto enemy caster on first wave to mess up melee kill sync
check vision plant debuff for info
mind game with residual vision on trinket ward
check minion info panel for cs
focus casters first
use s key to cs when alone or slow pushing
if minions barely die to ur waveclear ability, reset asap
### Macro:
  Chovy cosplay
Go mid to farm waves
If mid occupied > Sidelane
Take camps between actions after ~2 items
### Pressure:
  more pressure = easier gaming
Pushing is OP, it gives:
1. Vision in mid > info
2. Enemy needs to respond to a crash
3. Threatening towers
If enemy responds to ur push, rotate for number advantage
MID PRIO > objective (defenders advantage)
keep up the mid prio, AVOID TEAMFIGHTS
alternatively, use fog after push for the *element of surprise*
always **push > fight**
### Splitpushing:
  Mundo cosplay
When to duel:
1. If youre fed
2. If enemy has long cd ability down
3. If you have a flash to burn
4. If you think you can outplay
### Teamfighting:
  Be always prepared to fight
Farm up, exp up, build optimally
Position in front before the fight:
1. for poke
2. Bait engage (**Track enemy cooldowns!**)
If your team is trolling or enemy strong engage play *far* back
